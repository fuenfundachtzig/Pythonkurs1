    "> Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) can convert (snippets of) Python code to fast [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) bytecode  (optimized machine code) and thus decrease the execution time compared to standard Python code or even `numpy` routines. \n",
    "It runs on CPUs but can also exploit GPU hardware acceleration and offers advanced features like e.g. support for vectorization or automatic parallelization:\n",
    "* using the `vectorize()` decorator, Numba can compile a pure Python function into a ufunc that operates over NumPy arrays as fast as traditional ufuncs written in C.\n",
    "* the \"parallel\" option attempts to automatically parallelize and perform other optimizations on (part of) a function. At the moment, this feature only works on CPUs."
