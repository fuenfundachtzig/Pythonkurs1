    <body>Seattle, WA - Today an anonymous individual
           announced that NASA has completed building a
           Warp Drive and has parked a ship which uses
           the drive in his back yard.  This individual
           claims that although he hasn't been contacted by
           NASA concerning the parked space vessel, he assumes
           that he will be launching it later this week to
           mount an exhibition to the Andromeda Galaxy.
